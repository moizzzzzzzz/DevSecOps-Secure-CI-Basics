A beginner-friendly DevSecOps pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Features:
- ✅ Runs Python script
- 🧪 Scans secrets with GitLeaks
- 📏 Checks code quality using Flake8
- 🛡️ Scans for vulnerabilities using Trivy

## How it works:
Every time you push code to GitHub:
1. Python code is run
2. Secrets are scanned
3. Code is linted
4. Trivy checks for vulnerabilities
